# Multi-Session Runbook

This runbook tracks the work that turns the multi-session scaffolding landed in PRs 8–11 into a fully live runtime. The data model, slash commands, persistence schema, and tab bar all already exist on `main`; what remains is wiring the foreground/background swap, concurrent agent loops, and subagent fan-in.

## Current state on main (after the 2026-05 TUI overhaul + M1/M2)

- `SessionRouter` is live: each foreground/background session owns a real
  `SessionHandle` with its own `CancelToken`, and every event is multiplexed
  through a single `(session_id, TuiRuntimeEvent)` channel.
- `/session new|switch|close` actually spawn / swap / close sessions, and
  `/fork`, `/teammate`, `/worktree` register new agent loops.
- `WorkspaceIsolation::Worktree { branch }` is honored: `/teammate` and
  `/worktree` materialise a real `git worktree` under
  `<workspace_root>/.peridot/worktrees/<session_id>` (branch
  `peridot/teammate-<session_id>` by default) and tear it down on
  `/session close`. Two `Shared` sessions on the same cwd trigger a status
  warning so collisions are visible.
- Background events flow into `TuiState::record_background_event` —
  `SessionDirectoryItem` carries status / tokens / cost / pending_attention
  per session without polluting the foreground transcript.
- `CancelToken` is per-handle: Esc only cancels the foreground session.
- `MemoryStore::SessionRecord` persists `tui_state.json` / `context.bin`
  per session atomically; `peridot session save/show/resume/delete`
  round-trips.
- TUI tab bar (`SessionDirectoryItem`) renders multiple sessions; `Ctrl+T`/
  `Ctrl+W` cycle foreground; mascot bubble reflects the foreground state.
- 75 peridot-tui tests + 40 peridot-cli tests cover the surface,
  0 ignored, 0 flaky.

Outstanding for the next milestones: throttled persistence on every tick
(M3), `LocalSubAgentRunner` fan-in so `/fork` actually shares context with
its parent transcript (M4), and the attention notifier line (M5).

## Milestones

### M1 — Live SessionRouter spawn + event multiplex (landed)
- Replaced the single `tokio::spawn(run_agent_loop_with_events)` in `peridot-cli/src/main.rs` with router-driven `spawn_tui_agent_run(session_id, ...)`.
- Event channel now carries `(String session_id, TuiRuntimeEvent)`; the TUI listener filters by `current_session_id` for `apply_runtime_event` and updates `SessionDirectoryItem` counters for the rest via `TuiState::record_background_event`.
- `/session new`, `/session switch`, `/session close`, `/fork`, `/teammate`, `/worktree` all flow through the router instead of leaving "wiring pending" notices.

### M2 — Workspace isolation (landed)
- `/teammate` and `/worktree <branch>` materialise a real `git worktree` under `<workspace_root>/.peridot/worktrees/<session_id>` via `peridot_git::GitManager::add_worktree`. Branch defaults to `peridot/teammate-<session_id>` when not specified.
- `/session close` (and Esc-driven cancel) calls `GitManager::remove_worktree` so the worktree is torn down even when the agent loop ends abnormally.
- Two `Shared` sessions on the same cwd raise a transcript warning so silent file-write collisions are visible.
- Outstanding for the next milestone: handle process crash mid-run so leftover worktrees are pruned on startup.

### M3 — Persistence round-trip + crash recovery (landed)
- TUI loop calls `on_persist(&TuiState)` every tick; the CLI host throttles to one snapshot per second per session and writes `tui_state.json` atomically under `<project_root>/.peridot/sessions/<id>/` via `save_session_blob`.
- Every snapshot also updates `SessionRecord` (lifecycle / tokens / cost / turns / last_task) via `MemoryStore::save_session_record`.
- `peridot --resume <id>` now rebuilds the full foreground `TuiState` from the persisted blob when the run starts interactively; headless `--resume` keeps the existing prompt-injection behaviour.
- Startup scan downgrades any `SessionRecord` still marked `Running` to `Suspended` and surfaces the ids in the welcome transcript with the `peridot --resume <id>` hint.
- Context blob round-trip is wired end-to-end: the agent loop writes
  `<sessions_root>/<id>/context.bin` atomically after every turn via
  `ContextManager::snapshot_entries`, and `run_task_with_events` restores those
  entries through `ContextManager::restore_entries` before the next loop starts.
  `peridot --resume <id>` therefore reconstitutes both the TUI surface and the
  underlying conversation context.

### M4 — Subagent fan-in (`/fork`, `/teammate`, `/worktree`) (landed)
- `/fork`, `/teammate`, and `/worktree` register the new session with
  `SessionHandle.parent_id = current foreground id` and the
  `SessionDirectoryItem.kind` set to `fork` / `teammate` / `worktree` so the
  tree-shaped side panel can render the child under its parent.
- `TuiState::record_background_event` automatically promotes child events into
  `SubagentMonitorItem` entries (id + parent_id + tokens + kind + task)
  whenever the child's `parent_id` matches the foreground session — the
  parent transcript reflects child progress without forcing a tab swap.
- `/session close <child>` reuses the M2 worktree cleanup flow so cancelling
  a teammate / worktree subagent leaves no orphan directories or branches.
- Child sessions now inherit their parent's conversation. When
  `/fork`, `/teammate`, or `/worktree` spawns a child, `inherit_parent_context`
  copies `<sessions>/<parent>/context.bin` to `<sessions>/<child>/context.bin`
  before the agent loop starts, so `run_task_with_events` restores the parent's
  context entries on the first turn. Parents with zero completed turns leave
  the child with an empty context (silent no-op), matching the previous
  behaviour for that edge case.

### M38 — `peridot session list --status <state>` filter (landed)
- `peridot session list` now accepts `--status idle|running|suspended|done|failed` (case-insensitive). The match uses `SessionRecord.status` so sessions without a record are dropped from the filtered view (they would not match any lifecycle anyway).
- An unknown value is a hard error so the operator never sees a silently empty list because of a typo.

### M37 — `peridot session count` lifecycle breakdown (landed)
- One-shot tally of `SessionRecord`s grouped by `SessionLifecycle`: total / idle / running / suspended / done / failed. Useful for "is anything still in flight" or "do I have stale Running records the startup scan missed" without paging through `peridot session list`.

### M36 — Input box title carries character count (landed)
- Once the user starts typing, the input box's border title reads `" N chars "` (using the Unicode character count, so emoji/multibyte input is counted correctly). An empty buffer keeps the box title blank so the idle state stays clean.

### M35 — `/help` regenerates from slash catalog (landed)
- The `/help` slash now renders one line per `SlashCommandSpec` returned by `slash_command_catalog()`: `<name> <arg_hint>  ·  <description> [<category>]`. Newly registered slashes therefore appear in `/help` automatically — no more drift between the catalog and the help text.
- Output remains a single `push_transcript` so the existing transcript-wrap logic handles long help lists.

### M34 — `peridot version --detailed` (landed)
- Bare `peridot version` still prints `peridot <semver>` for backwards compatibility with scripts that grep the first token.
- `peridot version --detailed` adds three indented follow-up lines: `target: <os>`, `arch: <arch>`, and `profile: <release|dev>` when the binary was built with `CARGO_BUILD_PROFILE` propagated. Helpful when triaging "which binary is the operator running" against a release vs a local dev build.

### M33 — `peridot session show --transcript-tail N` (landed)
- `peridot session show <id> --transcript-tail N` prints the most recent N transcript entries (kind marker + text) under a `transcript (last N):` header, reusing the M10 load-with-fallback helper so even sessions that only have `transcript.ndjson` render the tail. JSON output exposes them under `transcript_tail: [{ kind, text }]`.
- Pairs with `--notes-tail N` (M30) so a single `show` invocation can answer "what happened recently in this session" without follow-up replay calls.

### M32 — Status bar carries active subagent count (landed)
- `render_status_metrics` appends `subagents N` when one or more entries in `state.subagents` have status `running` or `starting`. Done / failed subagents are excluded so the count means "in-flight work" rather than "lifetime spawn count" — useful when a TUI has spawned several `/fork` or `/teammate` sessions and the operator wants a quick activity gauge from the bottom bar without opening the side panel.

### M31 — `peridot agents show` carries path and rule count (landed)
- Text output now leads with `# <path> (<N> non-blank lines)` so the operator can tell exactly which instruction file is being read (`AGENTS.md` vs `CLAUDE.md` vs `.peridot/AGENTS.md` vs `.github/copilot-instructions.md`) and how many real rules are inside it. JSON output adds a matching `rule_count` field.

### M30 — `peridot session show --notes-tail N` (landed)
- `peridot session show <id> --notes-tail N` prints the most recent N notes from `notes.ndjson` inline beneath the existing session/record block (text output) or under a `notes_tail` array (JSON output). Pairs with M24's `notes_count` so the operator sees both "how many notes exist" and "what were the latest ones" in a single call.

### M29 — `peridot config models` catalog (landed)
- Prints the two configured model names from `PeridotConfig.models`: `main` (used by `HarnessAgent`) and `goal_checker` (used by goal mode). JSON output mirrors the same fields. Pairs with M27's `peridot config providers` so an operator can introspect both halves of "what runs where" without `peridot config show`'s full dump.

### M28 — `/info` slash one-shot session summary (landed)
- New `SlashCommand::Info` (no argument). When typed inside the TUI, prints a single transcript line that bundles `session id · workspace · model · provider · mode · permission · turn · tokens · cost` so an operator can confirm the entire session context without combining `/cost`, status bar, and tab bar.
- Picker advertises the command in the same `session` category as `/cost`, `/note`, and `/provider`.

### M27 — `peridot config providers` catalog (landed)
- Lists the five live provider keys the CLI accepts (`claude-api`, `openai-api`, `openrouter-api`, `openai-oauth`, `codex`) with short descriptions and marks the one currently set as `auth.primary` in the project config.
- JSON output mirrors the same shape (`{ active, providers: [{ name, description, active }] }`) so tooling can pick a sensible value before calling `peridot config set auth.primary <name>`.

### M26 — `/cost` slash includes model / provider / turn (landed)
- Re-renders the `/cost` notice in the transcript as `cost: $X · tokens: T · cache: H% · model: M · provider: P · turn: N` so a quick check answers "where am I, what am I running, and how much has it cost" in one glance.
- Provider falls back to `default` when no explicit `/provider` is in effect; turn is `state.current_turn` (0 before the first turn).

### M25 — `session note list --last N` (landed)
- `peridot session note <id> list` now accepts `--last N` to print only the most recent N entries from `notes.ndjson`. JSON output adds a `total` field next to `notes` so tooling knows when the slice is truncated; text output appends a "... showing X of Y notes; drop --last for the full list." footer in the same case.

### M24 — `peridot session show` carries notes summary (landed)
- `peridot session show <id>` now reads `notes.ndjson` (when present) and reports the note count plus the most recent note's body inline. Text output: `  notes: <count>  (<last text>)`; JSON output: `notes_count`, `last_note`.
- Sessions without a notes file render exactly as before, so the addition is backwards compatible.

### M23 — Status bar carries turn count (landed)
- `render_status_metrics` appends `turn N` once `state.current_turn` is greater than zero (i.e. the first `TurnStarted` event has fired). Idle sessions and freshly opened ones keep the metric hidden so the bar stays clean.

### M22 — `peridot session locate <id>` utility (landed)
- Prints the absolute path of `<project_root>/.peridot/sessions/<id>` along with whether it currently exists on disk. JSON output exposes the same shape (`{ id, path, exists }`).
- Useful for shell pipelines (`(peridot session locate id)/transcript.ndjson`) and for confirming where M16's export will source its files from before running.

### M21 — `/note` slash inside the TUI (landed)
- New `SlashCommand::Note(String)` and `/note <text>` slash entry. Inside the TUI, the slash queues the body onto `TuiState.pending_notes` and prints a transcript line so the user can see the note landed.
- `run_interactive_with_events` now hands the host a mutable `&mut TuiState` via `on_persist`. The CLI host's persist closure drains `pending_notes` every tick and appends one `{ts, text}` JSON line per note to the foreground session's `notes.ndjson`, matching the M20 file format. `peridot session note <id> list` then surfaces both CLI- and TUI-added notes uniformly.

### M20 — Operator notes per session (landed)
- `peridot session note <id> add <text>` appends a `{ts, text}` JSON line to `<sessions>/<id>/notes.ndjson` (created on demand) so an operator can annotate sessions without touching the transcript.
- `peridot session note <id> list` prints `[unix_ts] text` lines in chronological order (or returns `{ id, notes: [...] }` under `--output json`).
- `peridot session note <id> clear` removes `notes.ndjson` if it exists. Each notes file is independent of `tui_state.json` / `transcript.ndjson`, so a session can be exported / imported / pruned without touching the notes.

### M19 — Workspace label in status bar (landed)
- `HeaderState.workspace_label: Option<String>` (#[serde(default)]) carries the project root's basename. `peridot-cli` populates it from `project_root.file_name()` at TUI startup (and on resume) so the status bar reads `workspace <name>` next to mode/permission.
- The label is per-session, so a `/teammate` worktree session that targets a different checkout will naturally show a different `workspace` label than the foreground session.

### M18 — AGENTS.md hot reload (landed)
- `HarnessAgent::set_agents_md_path` lets the host point the agent at the AGENTS-style instruction file the project resolves (`.peridot/AGENTS.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, in that priority order). `peridot_project::locate_agents_md` resolves this from the project root.
- Every turn the agent loop calls `refresh_agents_md`: it compares `(modified_unix, len)` against the last-seen fingerprint and, when the file has been edited mid-run, re-reads the content, appends a trusted `ContextEntry::PlanReminder` carrying the new rules into the context, and emits `AgentRunEvent::AgentsMdLoaded` so the TUI side panel reflects the refresh. The first turn after `set_agents_md_path` always fires the inject because the signature starts as `None`.
- The check no-ops silently when the file is missing or unreadable, so removing `AGENTS.md` mid-run never blocks the agent.

### M17 — Session import (landed)
- `peridot session import <dir> [--id <id>] [--force]` is the inverse of M16's export: it copies every file from the source directory into `<project_root>/.peridot/sessions/<id>/`. The id defaults to the source directory's base name unless `--id` is provided.
- After the copy, the imported `tui_state.json` (if any) is deserialised once to register a `SessionSummary` carrying the session's `last_task` so `peridot session list` / `peridot session show` / `peridot --resume` see the imported session immediately.
- `--force` clears the destination directory before importing; otherwise an existing session id is a hard error so the user never silently merges files from two different exports.

### M16 — Portable session export (landed)
- `peridot session export <id> --out <dir> [--force]` copies every file inside `<sessions_root>/<id>/` (currently `tui_state.json`, `transcript.ndjson`, `context.bin`, plus any subdirectory the agent writes) into a fresh destination directory. Combine with `tar`/`zip` to ship a session to another machine.
- `--force` clears the destination directory first; otherwise an existing path is a hard error so the user never accidentally overwrites a different export.
- Text output prints the file list; JSON output returns `{ id, source, destination, files: [...] }` for tooling that wants to verify the copy.

### M15 — AskUser freeform multi-line input (landed)
- `Shift+Enter` while answering an `AskUser::FreeForm` prompt now inserts a literal newline instead of submitting. `Ctrl+J` does the same (some terminals deliver `Shift+Enter` as bare Enter, so the chord is the cross-terminal fallback). `Enter` without modifiers still submits.
- Existing `Backspace` / `Ctrl+H` deletion logic stays unchanged; rendering of the freeform value already wraps long lines because `ask_user` panels use the same `Wrap { trim: false }` policy as the transcript.

### M14 — Bulk prune of finished sessions (landed)
- `peridot session prune [--status <state>] [--older-than-days N] [--dry-run]` walks every `SessionRecord` and removes the ones matching all filters: `delete_session` (SQLite summary), `delete_session_record` (SQLite record), and `remove_session_dir` (on-disk blobs / ndjson).
- `--status` accepts `idle | running | suspended | done | failed`. Unknown values fail loudly so a typo never accidentally targets the wrong cohort.
- `--older-than-days N` skips sessions whose `updated_at_unix` is newer than `N * 86_400` seconds before now.
- `--dry-run` prints what *would* be removed and returns; combine with `--status` / `--older-than-days` to audit before sweeping.

### M13 — Cross-session transcript search (landed)
- `peridot session search <query> [--session <id>] [--limit N]` walks every persisted session under `<sessions_root>` (or just the one named by `--session`), loads its transcript via the M10 helper, and prints every entry whose text contains the substring (case-insensitive).
- Text output lists each hit as `<session>[<index>] <kind> <text>`; JSON output returns `{ "query", "total", "hits": [...] }` so downstream tooling can paginate or filter further. `--limit` short-circuits the walk after N matches to keep large workspaces responsive.

### M12 — Session list/show carry SessionRecord (landed)
- `peridot session list` now joins each `SessionSummary` with the matching `SessionRecord` written by M3's throttled persistence path. Text output appends `status / tokens / cost / turns`; JSON output nests the full record under each entry. Sessions without a record fall back to the previous summary-only view, so behaviour stays backwards compatible.
- `peridot session show` mirrors the same join with a more readable multi-line layout (status, workspace, tokens, cost, turns, optional worktree branch and last task). JSON output exposes the same nested shape for tooling.

### M11 — Live transcript tail (landed)
- `peridot session tail <id> [--from-now] [--interval-ms N]` prints the existing `transcript.ndjson` and then polls the file at `interval_ms` (default 200 ms, floored to 50 ms), printing every new line as it arrives with the same five-marker vocabulary the TUI uses. Ctrl+C terminates the watcher; no special signal handling needed.
- `--from-now` skips the existing journal and only prints entries written after the watch starts, useful when attaching mid-run.
- File truncation (e.g. by an external tool rotating the journal) resets the offset to 0 instead of stalling, so a fresh journal still streams correctly.

### M10 — Replay ndjson fallback (landed)
- `peridot session replay` now prefers the canonical `tui_state.json` snapshot but transparently falls back to `transcript.ndjson` when the snapshot is missing — which happens when a process was killed before the throttled `on_persist` could write but the per-tick M9 append already captured every entry. The result is that even uncleanly terminated sessions stay reviewable.
- The fallback parses ndjson line-by-line via `serde_json::from_str`, skipping blank lines and reporting the offending line number on bad payloads so a corrupted file points the operator at the right spot.

### M9 — Incremental transcript ndjson journal (landed)
- The on_persist callback now appends every newly observed `TranscriptEntry` to `<sessions_root>/<id>/transcript.ndjson` on every tick (no throttle). Per-session counts live in a `HashMap<String, usize>` inside the closure, so foreground swaps pick up the right entries for the right session.
- Append happens with `OpenOptions::append`; serde_json serialises each entry on its own line so external tools can `tail -f`/`jq` the live transcript without parsing JSON arrays.
- Failures (missing directory, write error) silently no-op so the UI thread never blocks on disk. The throttled `tui_state.json` snapshot from M3 keeps the canonical "load entire state" path.

### M8 — Per-session LLM provider override (landed)
- New `/provider <name>` slash command (also exposed in the slash picker / `/help`) records an explicit provider on `state.header.provider`. The status bar surfaces it as `provider <name>` in the metrics line.
- `apply_session_command`, submit, and approve callbacks all clone the project config and replace `auth.primary` with the session's provider before calling `spawn_tui_agent_run`, so concurrent sessions can run on different providers (e.g. one on `claude-api`, another on `openai-api` or `openrouter-api`) without mutating shared state.
- `HeaderState.provider` carries `#[serde(default)]`, so existing saved sessions resume with `None` (fall back to the config default).

### M7 — Replay journal CLI (landed)
- `peridot session replay <id> [--last N] [--step]` deserialises the persisted `tui_state.json` for that session and dumps the transcript entries with the same five-marker vocabulary the TUI uses (`▸ ◆ ❯ ✔ ✘ · ⚠ ? — …`). `--output json` returns the entries as a structured payload for tooling, and `--step` pauses for `Enter` between entries (type `q` to bail out early) so a session can be reviewed beat-by-beat.
- Reuses the on-disk format already written by the M3 throttled persistence path, so no new write codepath was needed.

### M6 — Per-session TuiState swap (landed)
- `run_interactive_with_events` now keeps a per-session `HashMap<String, TuiState>` of stashed states; every time `state.current_session_id` diverges from the foreground that was last rendered (Ctrl+T, Ctrl+W, `/session switch`), `swap_foreground_state` hot-swaps `state` so the visible transcript, plan, header counters, and active stream all jump to the new session.
- The latest `sessions` directory is always copied from the master view into the swapped-in state, so the tab bar stays consistent regardless of which session is foreground.
- Background sessions receive `apply_runtime_event` against their own stashed state in addition to the master `record_background_event` counter update — once the user swaps to them, the recorded transcript is already populated.
- Tests: round-trip `swap_foreground_state` between two sessions preserves each transcript and confirms the helper no-ops when target == previous.

### M5 — Attention notifier (landed)
- `TuiState::pending_attention_count()` reports how many non-foreground
  sessions are flagged `pending_attention`. The status bar renders
  `⚠ N{suffix}` using the new
  `PhraseKey::StatusSessionsAttentionSuffix` (En: " sessions need attention",
  Ko: "개 세션이 응답 대기 중") so the count flows through the existing
  i18n table.
- `render_text_snapshot` mirrors the indicator on a dedicated `attention:`
  line so headless previews and tests assert the message.
- Foreground swap from M1 already clears the `pending_attention` flag, so
  the indicator self-resolves once the user reads the background session.
- An optional `os-notify` cargo feature enables OS-level desktop notifications
  via `notify-rust`. When the feature is on, every background-session
  `ApprovalRequested` event fires a `Peridot: session needs attention` desktop
  notification carrying the gated tool's reason. The feature is off by default
  so the bare workspace build stays free of D-Bus / dbus / zbus link
  dependencies; `cargo build -p peridot-cli --features os-notify` opts in.

### M6 — Multi-session UX polish
- Per-session history (input recall) when swapping foreground.
- Session search/picker (`Ctrl+T` chord) with prefix match + recency.
- Aggregate budget/cost line in the status bar, distinct from per-session totals.

## Cross-cutting checklist for every multi-session PR

- [ ] `cargo fmt --all --check`
- [ ] `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings`
- [ ] `cargo test --workspace`
- [ ] `cargo build --release -p peridot-cli`
- [ ] New `PhraseKey` arms added for every new visible string (both En and Ko).
- [ ] New `AgentRunEvent` variants round-trip through the CLI adapter into a `TuiRuntimeEvent` arm.
- [ ] New struct fields carry `#[serde(default)]`; new enum variants are last so old serialised data deserialises.
- [ ] `SessionRouter` mutations stay single-threaded; readers use `try_read` with bounded timeout.
- [ ] No unbounded channels: bounded `mpsc::channel(1024)` or ring-buffer with oldest-drop.

## Risks tracked

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Foreground swap deadlock on `Arc<RwLock<TuiState>>` | `try_read` with timeout + single-writer (`SessionRouter::tick`). |
| Background event backpressure | bounded channel + oldest-drop; attention flag conveys "you missed N events". |
| Worktree leak when process crashes mid-run | startup scan reconciles open worktrees against `SessionRecord` lifecycle. |
| Cost double-counting across sessions | per-session totals + workspace aggregate stored separately, UI labels them. |
| Snapshot corruption on partial write | atomic `tempfile + rename`; never write to the final path directly. |

## Out of scope (until later)

- Cross-session memory sharing or context bleed.
- Network-replicated sessions (export/import a session to another machine).
- Mouse/touch input in the TUI.
- Container-level workspace sandboxing beyond git worktrees.
- Hot-swappable themes; the Peridot Night palette stays the default.
